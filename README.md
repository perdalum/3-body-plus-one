# "Simulation" of three-body system with a fourth body, e.g., a planet.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/kirklong/ThreeBodyBot and their Mastodon bot at https://mastodon.social/@threebodybot@mathstodon.xyz.

Triggered by The Three-Body Problem by [Liu Cixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin), but been slowly growing for decades...

Nothing is guaranteed to work besides it being pretty and fun.

## Future Work

- Ensure that the physics checks out...


## Motivation and TIL

- the javascript stack
- the javascript language
- git branching
- WebStorm
- using LLM for dev work
